These two files (menu-elements.json and project-info.json) are used to set up
the main variables of the dash. 

This is an example of the menu-elements.json file we are using for openstack

{
    "menu":{
        "scm": [
            "companies",
            "companies-summary",
            "contributors",
            "repos"
        ],
        "mls": [
            "companies",
            "contributors",
            "repos"
        ],
        "qaforums": ["tags"],
        "irc": [
            "contributors",
            "repos"
        ],
        "studies": [
            "demographics",
            "release"
        ],
        "its": [
            "companies",
            "contributors",
	    "states",
            "repos"
        ],
        "scr": [
            "companies",
            "companies-summary",
            "contributors"
        ],
        "downloads_OFF": [],
        "wiki_OFF": []
    },
    "releases":["essex","folsom","havana","icehouse"]
}

If the section name is not the "typical", it will be disabled from menu. Another
option is to remove it from the list. If you have issues with the menu, first
check if the JSON file is written with the correct syntax (you can use the 
command json_reformat)

The second file: projects-info.json is not really used now. The only important
variable now is "project_name".

These two files will be merged in a single configuration file
